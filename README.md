# Collaborative Data Set for Puzzlebot Vision

Colaborative dataset repository containing annotated images for training vision inference models for the Puzzlebot.

## Contribute

To obtain access dataset files, submit a minimum of **1500 annotated images**. A balance across all classes is highly encouraged. A minimum of **15%** (not exceeding 30%) of your images must be **null examples** (background). Once verified, processed and added, you will receive full access to the dataset.  

The images submitted should be in PNG format, with a resolution of **160x120 pixels**. The annotations should be in YOLO format, with each image having a corresponding label file containing the class ID and bounding box coordinates. Your corresponding data.yaml file generated by Roboflow or similar tools should include the class names in the order specified in ([Classes](#classes)) and paths to the training, validation, and test datasets.

## Dataset Characteristics

- Image Size: 160x120 pixels
- Image Format: JPG
- Annotation Format: YOLO TXT
- Number of Classes: 10

### Dataset Structure

The dataset is organized into the following structure:

``` txt
dataset/
├── train/
│   ├── images/
│   └── labels/
├── val/
│   ├── images/
│   └── labels/
├── test/
│   ├── images/
│   └── labels/
├── data.yaml
├── README.md
```

## Classes

| Class ID | Class Name       |
|----------|------------------|
| 0        | tl_green         |
| 1        | tl_red           |
| 2        | tl_yellow        |
| 3        | ts_left          |
| 4        | ts_right         |
| 5        | ts_straight      |
| 6        | ts_work          |
| 7        | ts_stop          |
| 8        | ts_roundabout    |
| 9        | ts_giveway       |

## Annotations

Annotations are provided in YOLO format, where each label file corresponds to an image file and contains the class ID and bounding box coordinates in the format:

```txt
<class_id> <x_center> <y_center> <width> <height>
```

### Example Annotation

For an image named `example_image.jpg`, the corresponding label file `example_image.txt` might look like this:

```txt
0 0.5 0.5 0.1 0.1
1 0.3 0.4 0.2 0.2
```

### Annotation Visual Example

### Data.yaml

The `data.yaml` file contains the dataset configuration, including class names and paths to the training, validation, and test datasets. Here is an example of what it *might* look like:

``` yaml
train: train/images
val: val/images
test: test/images
nc: 10
names: ['tl_green', 'tl_red', 'tl_yellow', 'ts_left', 'ts_right', 'ts_straight', 'ts_work', 'ts_stop', 'ts_roundabout', 'ts_giveway']
```

Additional information could be contained when using a enviromnent like Roboflow.
